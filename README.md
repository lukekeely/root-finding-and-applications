# root-finding-and-applications
Code from experiment. The primary focus was to investigate the efficiency of two root-finding algorithms: the Bisection and Newton-Raphson methods.

In this lab exercise, the primary focus was to investigate the efficiency of two root-finding algorithms: Bisection and Newton-Raphson methods. 
The algorithms were applied to find the roots of simple polynomials of various degrees. 
The two methods were studied under varying tolerances.

We look at the difference in the step growth on tighter tolerances and how each method might be applicable. 

If highly accurate answers are needed, the Newton-Raphson method is best suited as you can tighten tolerances.
The Bisection method is faster and easier for simpler problems where larger tolerances are allowed.

To see the application of such root-finding algorithms, I worked on finding the minimum value of an ionic interaction potential function.
